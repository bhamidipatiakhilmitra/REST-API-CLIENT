ENTER THE DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 Words


In a **REST API client** written in Java, several key tasks are performed to facilitate communication with a RESTful web service. These tasks are typically carried out using HTTP requests, processing responses, and handling exceptions. Here's a breakdown of the main tasks:

### 1. **Making HTTP Requests**
   The core function of a REST API client is to send HTTP requests to a server. These requests can be:
   - **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
   - **POST**: Send data to the server (often used to create new resources).
   - **PUT**: Update an existing resource on the server.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.

   The client constructs the request, specifying the method (GET, POST, etc.), the target URL (endpoint), any required headers (like `Authorization`), and the body (in the case of POST or PUT requests).

### 2. **Setting Headers and Authentication**
   Many REST APIs require additional information in the form of headers. A REST client in Java may set headers to:
   - **Content-Type**: Specifies the format of the data being sent (e.g., `application/json`).
   - **Authorization**: For securing API access, this header may carry tokens like `Bearer <token>` or other authentication methods.
   - **Accept**: Specifies the expected response format (e.g., `application/json`).

### 3. **Sending the Request**
   Once the request is constructed, it is sent to the server. This involves:
   - Creating an HTTP request using a suitable Java class or library (`HttpURLConnection`, `HttpClient`, etc.).
   - Using the chosen HTTP method to perform the desired action (GET, POST, etc.).
   - Including any necessary headers, parameters, and body content.

### 4. **Handling Response**
   After sending the request, the client receives a response from the server. The response typically includes:
   - **Status Code**: Indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).
   - **Headers**: Metadata about the response, such as content type or server information.
   - **Body**: The main data returned by the server, often in JSON or XML format.

   The client parses and processes the body (usually converting it into a Java object using a library like Jackson or Gson if the response is in JSON format).

### 5. **Error Handling**
   The client must be capable of handling different types of errors, including:
   - **HTTP Errors**: These are returned via status codes (e.g., 400, 500).
   - **Network Issues**: Errors related to connectivity, timeouts, or DNS resolution.
   - **Invalid Response**: If the response body cannot be parsed or if it is in an unexpected format.

   Exception handling mechanisms are implemented to catch these issues, allowing for retries, logging, or user notifications.

### 6. **Parsing and Mapping Data**
   Often, REST API responses are returned in JSON or XML format. A Java REST client needs to:
   - Parse the response body into a format that can be easily processed (usually JSON into Java objects).
   - Use libraries like **Jackson**, **Gson**, or **org.json** to map the response to Java objects for further use.

### 7. **Asynchronous Requests (Optional)**
   For non-blocking operations, modern Java REST clients (e.g., `HttpClient` in Java 11) may send requests asynchronously, allowing the application to continue other operations while waiting for the response.

In summary, a Java REST API client performs a sequence of tasks to send requests, handle responses, process data, and manage errors, enabling seamless communication with web services.
